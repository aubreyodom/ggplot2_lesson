## Why ggplot2?

### Advantages of ggplot2
- It's consistent! gg = "grammar of graphics"; easy base system for adding/removing plot elements, with room for being fancy too.
- Very flexible
- Themes available to polish plot appearance
- Active maintenance/development = getting better all the time!
- It can do quick-and-dirty and complex, so you only need one system
- Plots, or whole parts of plots, can be saved as objects
- Easy to add complexity or revert to earlier plot

### Disadvantages of ggplot2
- Difficult to work with in iterated functions
- No 3-D graphics
- Only "graph theory" type graphs
- ggplot is often slower than base graphics
- The default colors can be difficult to change
- You might need to change the structure of your data frame to make certain plots (use tidyr::pivot_wider() and tidyr::pivot_longer())

## First off, install ggplot2
```{r install ggplot2, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

```{r load ggplot2}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Example dataset: Diamonds

![Diamonds](diamonds_desc.png){width=50%}

```{R}
head(diamonds)
```
![Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification. A stone is graded as flawless if, under 10-power magnification, no inclusions (internal flaws) and no blemishes (external imperfections) are visible.](clarity.png){width=50%}

- The dataset contains information about 53,940 round-cut diamonds

- There are 10 variables measuring various pieces of information about the diamonds.

- There are 3 variables with an ordered factor structure: cut, color, & clarity

## Transitioning from base plotting to `ggplot2`

There are two functions to know: `qplot()` and `ggplot()`.

```{R compare functions}
# load the diamonds dataset
data(diamonds)

plot(diamonds$carat, diamonds$price, main = "I'm a base plot")

qplot(x = carat, y = price, data = diamonds, geom = "point") +
  ggtitle("I'm a qplot")

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point() +
  ggtitle("I'm a ggplot")

```

### Using `qplot`

`qplot()` is a shortcut that will be familiar to anyone using the `base::plot()`. It's great for making some basic plot types, like scatterplots, boxplots, histograms, and jitter plots, but it doesn't allow for complex plots like ggplot does.
```{r qplot ex}
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Diamond Carat versus Price",
       x = "Carat", y = "Price")
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds, color = color) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Diamond Carat versus Price",
       x = "Carat", y = "Price",
       subtitle = "With Diamond Color")
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds, size = color, color = color) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Diamond Carat versus Price",
       x = "Carat", y = "Price",
       subtitle = "With Diamond Color")
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds, facets = clarity ~ color) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Diamond Carat versus Price",
       x = "Carat", y = "Price",
       subtitle = "Separated by Clarity and Color")
```

Here, we add a theme:
```{r qplot ex 2}
mod <- lm(price ~ carat + color + clarity, data = diamonds)
qplot(resid(mod), fitted(mod),
      main = "Residuals vs. Fitted Values") + 
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Residuals", y = "Fitted Values")
```

```{r qplot geoms}
set.seed(92)
# Use different geoms
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds, geom = "path") +
  labs(title = "Path plot of carat versus price",
       x = "Carat", y = "Price")

# For illustration purposes, use only a subset of the data
diamonds_sub <- diamonds[sample(size = 400, x = nrow(diamonds)), ]
qplot(clarity, price, data = diamonds_sub,
      geom = c("boxplot", "jitter")) +
  labs(title = "Jittered Boxplot of clarity versus price",
       x = "Clarity", y = "Price")
qplot(clarity, data = diamonds_sub,
      geom = "dotplot") +
  labs(title = "Dotplot of diamond clarity",
       x = "Clarity")
```

## Using `ggplot2` for more complex plots

Use facet_grid() or facet_wrap() to create a separate plot for each value of a factor variable. We donâ€™t have to change any of the original plotting code, just add the facet command to it. Faceting can also be done on more than one categorical variable to create a grid of plots.
```{r}
# make the basis for a plot using ggplot save it as an object, p
p <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))
# add a geom (points) and display the plot
p + geom_point() + facet_grid(. ~ color, labeller = label_both) +
  labs(x = "Carat", y = "Price", title = "Carat versus price, separated by color")
```

### Multivariate Exploration using Colors and Facet

```{r ggplot colors}
# color by a continuous variable
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = depth)) + 
  geom_point() 
# color by a factor variable
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) + 
  geom_point()
```


### Building plots in layers

Sometimes, it is helpful to save a simpler version of a plot, and then add onto it later with additional layers (for example, an if/else statement that plots different layers dependent on if a criterion is met or not).

We might want to summarize the data in the previous plot with a smoother on top of the points. With ggplot, we can simply add the geom_smooth command. Each geom just adds another layer to the plot.

```{R}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + geom_smooth()

```

#### Making a layered histogram

A layered histogram is a great way to compare the distribution of a variable across groups. `geom_histogram` works well for two groups, but geom_density is easier to look at for several groups.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price, fill = cut)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
```
